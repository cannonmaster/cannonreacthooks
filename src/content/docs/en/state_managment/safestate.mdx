## Introduction

A custom React Hook that ensures the safety of component unmounting.

## Play

<div style="margin-top: 3%;">
  <UseSafeState client:visible />
</div>

## Usage

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useSafeState } from "@cannonui/reacthooks";
useState;

const ChildCmp = () => {
  const value = 0;
  const [safeVal, withSetSafeState] = useSafeState<number>(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      withSetSafeState((prev) => prev + 1);
    }, 3000);

    return () => {};
  }, []);

  return <div>safe value: {safeVal}</div>;
};
const TestUseSafeState = () => {
  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(true);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setVisible(false)}>
        click to prevent value update after component unmount
      </button>
      {visible && <ChildCmp />}
    </div>
  );
};

export default TestUseSafeState;
```

## Return Value

The hook returns an array containing the safe state value and a function `withSetSafeState` to update the state safely.

## Parameters

| Name    | Type | Description        |
| ------- | ---- | ------------------ |
| `value` | `T`  | The initial value. |

## Features

- Ensures that component unmounting won't trigger state updates for unmounted components.
- Provides the `withSetSafeState` function to safely update the state.

## Example

In this example, we have a child component called `ChildCmp` that uses the `useSafeState` hook to ensure that state updates won't be triggered after the component is safely unmounted. The `ChildCmp` component tries to update the state after 3 seconds, but since the parent component `TestUseSafeState` sets `visible` to `false`, the `ChildCmp` component is already unmounted before the state update.

## Use Scenario

The `useSafeState` hook is useful in scenarios where you need to ensure that state updates won't be triggered after the component is unmounted. Often, there are asynchronous operations that may still be running before the component unmounts. If state updates continue to be triggered after unmounting, it can lead to errors or exceptions in the application. By using the `useSafeState` hook, you can avoid such situations and improve the overall stability of your application.
