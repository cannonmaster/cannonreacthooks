## Parameters

| Name    | Type                     | Description                                                                     |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ref`   | `RefObject<HTMLElement>` | A ref object representing the HTML element.                                     |
| `delay` | `number`                 | The delay (in milliseconds) before updating the scrolling state. (default: 150) |

## Features

- Tracks whether the specified element is currently being scrolled.
- Provides a boolean value to indicate the scrolling state.

## Example

In this example, we have a component called `TestUseScrolling` that uses the `useScrolling` Hook to track whether the specified `div` element is being scrolled. The scrolling state is displayed in the UI as "scrolling" or "not scrolling."

## Use Scenario

The `useScrolling` Hook is useful when you need to monitor whether a specific element is being scrolled, and based on that, you may want to trigger some actions or show relevant UI elements. For example, you might want to display a "Back to Top" button when the user scrolls down a page, and this Hook helps you track the scrolling behavior of the container element.
