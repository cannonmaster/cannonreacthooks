## Introduction

The `useMouse` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to track the mouse position and the mouse position relative to an element.

## Play

<div style="margin-top: 3%;">
  <TestUseMouse client:only />
</div>

## Usage

1. Import the `useMouse` hook into your component:

```jsx
import { useMouse } from "@cannonui/reacthooks";
```

2. Initialize the hook in your component:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useMouse } from "@cannonui/reacthooks";

const TestUseMouse = () => {
  const [state, refMouse] = useMouse();
  const [bgColor, setBgColor] = useState("cyan");

  useEffect(() => {
    if (
      state.elementY >= 0 &&
      state.elementY <= 200 &&
      state.elementX >= 0 &&
      state.elementX <= 300
    ) {
      setBgColor("pink");
    } else {
      setBgColor("cyan");
    }
  }, [state.elementX, state.elementY]);

  return (
    <>
      <pre>current state: {JSON.stringify(state, null, 2)}</pre>

      <div
        ref={refMouse}
        style={{
          width: "300px",
          height: "200px",
          border: "1px solid cyan",
          backgroundColor: bgColor,
        }}
      ></div>
    </>
  );
};

export default TestUseMouse;
```

## How it Works

The `useMouse` hook utilizes the `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` hooks from React to track the mouse position and the mouse position relative to an element. It returns an object containing `x` and `y` properties for the mouse position on the screen, and `elementX` and `elementY` properties for the mouse position relative to the specified element. It also provides `elementPositionX` and `elementPositionY` properties to get the element's position on the screen.

The hook sets up a `mousemove` event listener on the document to track the mouse position, and it calculates the relative position by subtracting the element's bounding rectangle from the mouse position.

## Example

In the example above, we have created a simple component `TestUseMouse` that uses the `useMouse` hook to track the mouse position and the mouse position relative to a `<div>` element. The component displays the current mouse state in a `<pre>` tag and changes the background color of the element based on the mouse's position relative to the element.

This custom hook can be useful when you need to implement mouse-related interactions or visual feedback based on the mouse's position relative to specific elements.

Please note that this hook tracks the mouse position and relative position only on the client-side and may not be accurate during server-side rendering or when running on the server.
