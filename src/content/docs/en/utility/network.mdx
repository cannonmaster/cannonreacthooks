import TestUseNetwork from "@hook/network/demo";

## Introduction

The `useNetwork` hook is a custom React hook that provides network status information on the client-side.

## Play

<div style="margin-top: 3%;">
  <TestUseNetwork client:only />
</div>

## Usage

1. Import the `useNetwork` hook into your component:

```jsx
import { useNetwork } from "@cannonui/reacthooks";
```

2. Initialize the hook in your component:

```jsx
const TestUseNetwork = () => {
  const networkState = useNetwork();

  return (
    <div>
      <h5>Network Status (client side only)</h5>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(networkState, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## How it Works

The `useNetwork` hook utilizes the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from React to monitor the network status on the client-side. It returns an object containing various network-related properties such as `online`, `rtt`, `type`, `downlink`, `saveData`, `downlinkMax`, and `effectiveType`.

The hook sets up event listeners to track changes in the network status and updates the state accordingly.

## Example

In the example above, we have created a simple component `TestUseNetwork` that uses the `useNetwork` hook to display the network status on the client-side. The `networkState` object contains information about the current network status, including the online status, round trip time (`rtt`), connection type (`type`), downlink speed (`downlink`), whether data saving is enabled (`saveData`), maximum downlink speed (`downlinkMax`), and effective connection type (`effectiveType`).

The hook automatically updates the network status whenever there is a change, such as a switch from online to offline or a change in the network type.

This custom hook can be useful when you need to adapt your application's behavior based on the user's network conditions or when you want to display network-related information to the user.

Please note that this hook works only on the client-side, and its values may not be accurate during server-side rendering or when running on the server.
