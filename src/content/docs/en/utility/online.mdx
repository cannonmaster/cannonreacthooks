import UseOnline from "@hook/online/demo";

## Introduction

A custom React Hook for detecting online/offline status.

## Play

<div style="margin-top: 3%;">
  <UseOnline client:only />
</div>

## Usage

```tsx
import { useOnline } from "@cannonui/reacthooks";
const TestUseOnline = () => {
  const online = useOnline();
  return <div>{online ? "online" : "not online"}</div>;
};
export default TestUseOnline;
```

## Return Value

The hook returns a boolean value indicating whether the browser is online or offline.

## Features

- Detects the online/offline status of the browser.
- Provides a boolean value indicating whether the browser is online (`true`) or offline (`false`).

## Example

In this example, we have a component called `TestUseOnline` that uses the `useOnline` Hook to detect the online/offline status of the browser. The hook listens for the `online` and `offline` events of the `window` object and updates the `online` state accordingly.

## Use Scenario

The `useOnline` Hook is useful in scenarios where you want to detect the online/offline status of the browser and perform certain actions based on the network connectivity. For example, you might want to show a notification when the user goes offline or fetch data from the server when the user comes back online. By using the `useOnline` Hook, you can easily handle online/offline events and implement network-aware behavior in your React application.
