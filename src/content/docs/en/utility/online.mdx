## Introduction

The `useRenderTrack` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to track the number of times a component is rendered.

## Play

<div style="margin-top: 3%;">
  <UseOnline client:only />
</div>

## Usage

1. Import the `useRenderTrack` hook into your component:

```jsx
import { useRenderTrack } from "@cannonui/reacthooks";
```

2. Initialize the hook in your component:

```jsx
import { useState, StrictMode } from "react";
import useRenderTrack from "./useRenderTrack";

const TestUserRenderTrack = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
  const renderTrack = useRenderTrack();

  const handleIncrement = () => {
    setValue((value) => value + 1);
  };

  return (
    <StrictMode>
      <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
      <div>Increment times: {value}</div>
      <div>Actually rendered times: {renderTrack} times</div>
    </StrictMode>
  );
};

export default TestUserRenderTrack;
```

## How it Works

The `useRenderTrack` hook utilizes the `useRef` hook from React to keep track of the number of times the component is rendered. It creates a ref named `renderTrack` and increments its value every time the component renders.

## Example

In the example above, we have created a simple component `TestUserRenderTrack` that uses the `useRenderTrack` hook to track the number of times it's rendered. The component also provides a button that increments a counter (`value`) when clicked.

The hook ensures that the rendering count (`renderTrack`) is accurately tracked, even if the component's state changes due to user interactions or other updates.

This custom hook is helpful when you need to monitor the frequency of component renders for performance optimization or debugging purposes.

Please note that the hook only tracks the number of renders on the client-side and may not be accurate during server-side rendering or when running on the server.
