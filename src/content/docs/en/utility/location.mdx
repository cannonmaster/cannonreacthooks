## Introduction

A custom React Hook for tracking and managing the current browser location.

## Play

<div style="margin-top: 3%;">
  <UseLocation client:only />
</div>

## Usage

```tsx
import { useLocation } from "@cannonui/reacthooks";
const LocationDisplay = () => {
  const location = useLocation();

  return (
    <div>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(location, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
};
const TestUseLocation = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <LocationDisplay />
    </div>
  );
};
export default TestUseLocation;
```

## Return Value

The hook returns an object of type `Location` containing various properties related to the current browser location.

## Properties of `Location`

| Name       | Type                          | Description                                                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `trigger`  | `string`                      | The trigger that caused the location change (e.g., "popstate" or "hashchange"). |
| `state`    | `Record<string, any> \| null` | The state associated with the current location (from the browser history API).  |
| `length`   | `number`                      | The length of the browser history.                                              |
| `hash`     | `string`                      | The hash portion of the current location (e.g., "#section1").                   |
| `host`     | `string`                      | The host and port of the current location (e.g., "example.com:8080").           |
| `hostname` | `string`                      | The host name of the current location (e.g., "example.com").                    |
| `href`     | `string`                      | The full URL of the current location.                                           |
| `origin`   | `string`                      | The origin of the current location (e.g., "http://example.com:8080").           |
| `pathname` | `string`                      | The pathname portion of the current location (e.g., "/products").               |
| `port`     | `string`                      | The port of the current location (e.g., "8080").                                |
| `protocol` | `string`                      | The protocol of the current location (e.g., "http:" or "https:").               |
| `search`   | `string`                      | The query string portion of the current location (e.g., "?id=123").             |

## Features

- Tracks and manages the current browser location.
- Provides various properties related to the current location, such as pathname, search, hash, host, and more.
- Supports detecting location changes triggered by history API (`popstate`) and hash changes (`hashchange`).

## Example

In this example, we have a component called `TestUseLocation` that uses the `useLocation` Hook to track and display the current browser location. The `LocationDisplay` component displays the location properties obtained from the `useLocation` Hook.

## Use Scenario

The `useLocation` Hook is useful in scenarios where you need to access and react to changes in the current browser location. It allows you to build location-aware React components and implement dynamic behavior based on the URL or browser history changes. For example, you can use it to implement client-side routing, conditionally render components based on the current URL, or update the application state when the user navigates through different routes.
