description: A custom React Hook for performing GET requests and handling loading and errors.

import useGet from "@hook/get";

## Introduction

The `useGet` hook is a custom React Hook that facilitates GET requests and handles the loading state and errors for such requests. It is particularly useful when you need to retrieve data from a server or API using GET requests and want to handle the loading and error states in your React components efficiently.

## Usage

```tsx
import React from "react";
import useGet from "./useGet";

const TestUseGet = () => {
  const { res, isLoading, err } = useGet("http://localhost:3001");

  return (
    <>
      <div>isLoading: {isLoading ? "true" : "false"}</div>
      {err ? <div>Error: {err.message}</div> : <div>no error</div>}
      <div>res: {res ? res.data : ""}</div>
    </>
  );
};

export default TestUseGet;
```

## Return Value

The hook returns an object containing the following properties:

| Name        | Type                 | Description                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `res`       | ResponseData \| null | The response data from the GET request, if any.      |
| `isLoading` | boolean              | A boolean indicating whether the request is loading. |
| `err`       | Error \| null        | The error object in case of an error, if any.        |

## Parameters

| Name     | Type                              | Description                                      |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `url`    | string                            | The URL from which the GET request will be sent. |
| `config` | ExtendedRequestOptions (optional) | Additional configuration for the GET request.    |

## Features

- Facilitates GET requests in React components, simplifying the process of fetching data from a server or API.
- Automatically handles the loading state, allowing you to display a loading indicator while the GET request is ongoing.
- Provides an error object to handle and display any errors that occur during the GET request.
- Can be customized using the optional `config` parameter to add additional headers, set a timeout, or handle request retries.

## Example

In the `TestUseGet` component, we use the `useGet` hook to make a GET request to the URL "http://localhost:3001". The `useGet` hook handles the GET request and provides the `res`, `isLoading`, and `err` values to manage the loading and error states.

The component conditionally renders different content based on the state of the GET request. If the request is still loading, it displays "isLoading: true". If there's an error, it displays an error message with the error's `message`. If the request is successful (`res` is not `null`), it displays the response data (`res.data`).

You can use the `TestUseGet` component in your application whenever you need to handle GET requests to retrieve data from a server or API, and it will automatically manage the loading and error states, providing a smooth user experience.

## Use Scenario

The `useGet` hook is useful in scenarios where you need to perform GET requests in a React component and handle the loading and error states associated with those requests. It allows you to interact with APIs or servers to retrieve data while maintaining a smooth user experience by displaying loading indicators and handling errors gracefully.
