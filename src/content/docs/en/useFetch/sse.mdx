import UseSse from "@hook/sse/demo";

## Introduction

The `useSse` hook is a custom React Hook that allows you to receive Server-Sent Events (SSE) from the server. SSE is a simple and efficient way to send real-time updates from the server to the client over a single HTTP connection.

## Parameters

| Name  | Type     | Description                   |
| ----- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `url` | `string` | The URL for the SSE endpoint. |

## Features

- Receives Server-Sent Events (SSE) from the server in real-time.
- Automatically updates the state with the received data.

## Example

```tsx
import useSse from "./sse";

const TestUseSse = () => {
  const data = useSse<string>("http://localhost:3001/sse");

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default TestUseSse;
```

In this example, we have a component called `TestUseSse` that uses the `useSse` hook to receive Server-Sent Events (SSE) from the server. The `data` state is updated with the received data, and we render the data as a list of items.

## Server-Side Code

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/sse", (req, res) => {
  console.log("SSE connection established");
  res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/event-stream");
  res.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache");
  res.setHeader("Connection", "keep-alive");

  let counter = 0;

  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    counter++;
    res.write(`data: ${counter}\n\n`);
    if (counter === 10) {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
      res.end();
    }
  }, 2000);
});

const port = 3001;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

In this server code, we have defined an SSE endpoint at `/sse`. When a client makes a request to this endpoint, the server establishes an SSE connection and starts sending data every 2 seconds. The data sent to the client is a simple counter that increments from 1 to 10. Once the counter reaches 10, the server closes the SSE connection using `res.end()`.

## Use Scenario

The `useSse` hook is useful when you need to receive real-time updates from the server in your React application. It allows you to easily handle SSE connections and update the client's state with the received data.
